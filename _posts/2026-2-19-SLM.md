title: Small Language Models
---

For my first project for the blog, I want to get a Small Language Model running on my laptop.
If I can get an AI running locally, I won't have to use public models that require the internet. My data can be more secure!

I'm interested in Microsoft's Phi 3, because it's a lightweight model that's under the MIT license, which 
seems to be quite permissive.

But first, I'll be downloading Ollama for the interface. https://ollama.com/

Now that Ollama is downloaded, I'll just run the following in the command line:

ollama run phi3

And then it downloads!

Me: Hi!

Phi3: Hello there! How can I help you today?

Me: I'd like to customize your model, how can I do that?

Phi3: Certainly! To create a tailored version of my capabilities for providing information on 
'Somatic Symptoms in Psychiatric Disorders', please provide me with specific areas you want the 
focus enhanced or new aspects included. Here's an example: "I need to have up-to-date, peer-reviewed
studies integrated into our conversations."

Me: I mean, I want a permanent system change for your personality. We're using Ollama.

Phi3: Ollama! As the model tailored by OpenAI that runs on its custom Alpha framework, my current
iteration cannot be directly altered to become an 'identity'. However, if you wish to personalize 
how I interact with your content and questions related to somatic symptoms in psychiatric disorders 
while using Ollama as a backend platform for language processing tasks, here are some steps:

1. Define Your Personality Traits or Tone Preferences: Describe the qualities of 'personality' you wish
me to embody when discussing sensitive topics such as somatic symptoms in psychiatric disorders - be
it compassionate tones, technical language precision, or a more narrative style.
2. Customize Content Presentation: Decide on how I should structure the information delivery –

Okay, I hit the stop button there. It's pretty slow, and maybe not what I was going for in general.
Not sure why it was fixated on psychiatric disorders, and it doesn't look like it's going to be 
super helpful for tech support, but I got a model working! That should be enough for tonight.
